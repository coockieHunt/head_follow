    "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.",
    "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.",
    "Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.",
    "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.",
    "The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.",
    "Equipped with his five senses, man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure Science."
